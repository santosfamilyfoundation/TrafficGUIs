## Dependencies
If you are planning on doing development for SantosGui, we recommend that you use a Python dependency manager like `conda`. Directions to install Anaconda or Miniconda2 can be found [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).

We recommend creating a virtual environment to hold the dependencies for SantosGUI.  Check out the [full instructions](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) on how to create virtual environments for `conda`. Once you have a conda environment set up with the example name `yourenvname`, run the bash script to install all neccessary dependencies into your virtual environment like so

```
sh install_conda_deps.sh yourenvname
```
